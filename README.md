FlyLeaf
===

Welcome to FlyLeaf! 
---------------
FlyLeaf is a WordPress theme that is built on the awesome [_S Framework](http://underscores.me). What _S provides is a great foundation that provides awesome security and the base features that any theme should provide. What FlyLeaf does is that you get a great single-column layout for your blog that is responsive for any sized devices on the market. 

Getting Started
---------------
 It is really easy to get started with FlyLeaf. Since it is a focused and minimal theme we purposefully didn't add a lot of extra features that are not needed by everyone. This means that your theme will be faster and easier to maintain. We wanted FlyLeaf to help you focus on producing awesome content for your readers. 

 WordPress has already written great tutorials for a lot of features the FlyLeaf offers and thus we will be linking to those tutorials since they already cover them and we would like WordPress to be the central place to look when learning how to use and troubleshoot any WordPress theme. 

### Installing

To install your theme, you will need to make sure to download the theme files from wherever you have purchased the theme. From there, follow the directions that WordPress offers to install a theme.
